# ReadMe-Gen

  ## Description
  This is a "ReadMe.md" generator, meant to allow users to enter in their project descriptions, instillation, usage information, contribution instructions, and how to test the program.

  ## Installation
  Simply download a zip version of the file from my GitHub Profile, extract the contents, open it up in Git Bash, and type in "node index.js" to activate the appropriate file. From there, the program should prompt the user for the respective details of their project. 

  ## Usage
  For anyone who needs a ReadMe, this is the program for you. For everything else... Search for others.

  ## Contributing
  None. Not Open to Contribution (sry)

  ## Tests
  Oops...I provided those elsewhere. Go back to instillation instructions... it's short enough to cover both really.
