# ReadMe-Gen

  ## Description
  Writing ReadMe files can be a hassle- so use a bit of code to simplify your life! ðŸŽ‰ The index.js file included in this repository is coded to be a ReadMe.md generator. As implied, it can be run from Bash in order to generate a ReadMe file. An example of a generated ReadMe can be found in the assets folder, and this ReadMe is similarly styled.

  ## Installation
  There are multiple ways to install. One method is to download a zip version of the file from the repository at https://github.com/Will-Riffe/ReadMe-Gen and extract the contents. Alternatively, you can follow Github command line instructions for Bash (or similar console) to create a copy or fork. 

  ## Usage
  The following [Walkthrough Video](https://clipchamp.com/watch/SJYJyu4CxWH) should sufficiently demonstrate the capabilities of this project, as well as instruct you on how to use it. If you don't trust the link, then do the following: after downloading (and extracting the files if necessary) the user should run Git Bash from the file location of index.js (which should be in the assets folder) and type in "node index.js" into the Bash terminal. The program will begin to prompt the user for different subjects, such as the repository description, installation instructions, etc. When the user finishes answering the prompts, the program will generate the ReadMe.md file in the root directory, where the user can edit it from there.

  ## Reference
  I was inspired by both the Week 9 miniproject demonstration, as well as [Connie Tran's](https://github.com/connietran-dev/readme-generator) version of the ReadMe generator; although I would point out that my code differs quite a bit when you look past the actual prompts.
